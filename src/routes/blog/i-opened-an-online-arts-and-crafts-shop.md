People selling [colorful anime keychains](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1056007535/cute-anime-keychain) and [other trinkets](https://www.etsy.com/listing/986220160/printable-toddler-worksheets-or-toddler) looks like a fun business.

See this? Who wouldn't want to sell [lovingly crafted, legally-ambiguous merchandise](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1196065093/fully-functional-3d-printed-pokeball)? I mean, it's definitely more fun than preparing a powerpoint presentation trying to impress a room full of suits.

I personally like buying webcomic merch, like [quirky graphic t-shirts](https://topatoco.com/collections/drhastings/products/rb-highfive), so maybe I have some idea of what makes a good product. However, I've never done anything like it before. Here's what my [Work Diet](/blog/i-left-my-office-job) currently looks like:

<WorkDiet show_hours={false} legend={true} data=
  {[
    [
      { item: "Uber driving", hours: 0, status: "inactive" },
      { item: "freelancing", hours: 0, status: "inactive" },
      { item: "tutoring", hours: 0, status: "inactive" },
      { item: "stocks", hours: 0.5, status: "passive" },
    ],
    [
      { item: "blogging", hours: 0, status: "inactive" },
      { item: "Etsy / Redbubble / Zazzle", hours: 10, status: "paused" },
      { item: "real estate investing", hours: 0, status: "inactive" },
      { item: "streaming", hours: 0, status: "inactive"},
    ],
    [
      { item: "websites", hours: 0, status: "inactive" },
      { item: "apps", hours: 0, status: "inactive" },
      { item: "APIs", hours: 0, status: "inactive" },
    ],
    [
      { item: "art", hours: 0, status: "inactive" },
      { item: "making videogames", hours: 0, status: "inactive"},
      { item: "3D modeling", hours: 0, status: "inactive" },
    ],
    [
      {item: "RPi game console", hours: 0, status: "paused"},
    ]
  ]} />

Note all this stuff is captured by the item labeled "Etsy / Redbubble / Zazzle". I put it on the second lowest level because the barrier to entry is almost non-existent. If you can sign up for an online account and upload images, you can make an online store.

I am also anticipating some work required to research clever ideas and turn graphic designs into products. For this reason, it's one higher than the lowest level. In hindsight, I can tell you that I vastly underestimated the level of skill and effort required to get an online shop off the ground. Let me tell you about the challenges I faced, what I found I was capable of, and what I could have done better.

## My Familiarity with Online Shopping

The idea of starting a shop isn't new to me. I added this idea when I read a Forbes article about a working mom who started a "printable" shop (calendars, notebooks, cards, prints, etc). Prior to that, I've seen people on social media advertising their 3D printed hair pin crafts and video game related items. Coincidentally, getting into 3D printing last year has somewhat renewed my interest.

## What E-Commerce Platform Should I Choose?

Off the top of my head, I have experience with three large online e-commerce stores: Etsy, Zazzle, and Redbubble. Many people have heard of the first one, probably from a relative selling home-made crafts they do as a hobby. I am familiar with the other two stores as a one-time customer and both instances were pretty positive interactions.

I don't think this choice is too important when you're starting out, though I wanted to go with an established all-in-one service just to make it easier. I decided to constrain my search to the three platforms I'd mentioned earlier so that I could learn about the pros and cons of each in about 10 minutes.

### Etsy

![Etsy's Current Front Page](/articles/shop-etsy.png "Etsy.com")

It looks like [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com) is the most popular, but takes the biggest cut as a result of their strong market position. That last thing is a source of recent controversy and many shop owners are unhappy about it. Etsy's terms of service also explicitly states that they only allow handmade crafts to be sold, but that definition apparently can be stretched very far (they allow 3d prints and printed t-shirts and printed stuff) as long as there is some aspect of the product that has to be "handmade" (read: "customized") by the shop owner. I've never bought anything from Etsy before.

### Redbubble

![Redbubble's Current Front Page](/articles/shop-redbubble.png "Redbubble.com")

[Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com) is a wilderness of copyright infringement; a wild-west of cheap knock-off merchandise. Some of their users complain that sending designs to Redbubble just makes it easier for shameless clones to spring up in a matter of days. I've bought from Redbubble once and it's really good for getting crappy merchandise for unimportant one-off gifts (e.g. a pokemon themed notebook for a work-related event). Otherwise, this sounds like something to avoid...

### Zazzle

![Zazzle's Current Front Page](/articles/shop-zazzle.png "Zazzle.com")

[Zazzle](https://www.zazzle.com) is a less well known competitor but internet denizens seem to really like this one. It's not as well known so the cut they take is *sliiightly* less than Etsy. It's also not as bad as Redbubble when it comes to knock-offs and is also more lax about handmade items. I bought a t-shirt off of Zazzle once and it was a nice shirt.

In the end I decided to go with Zazzle and began making an account.

## Creating My Store

I got sidetracked into making some store graphics for a couple hours:

![Parsnip Designs Logo](/articles/parsnip-designs-no-text-logo.png "Parsnip Designs Official Store Logo")

I slapped together a logo in a few hours using GIMP. I chose a controller silhouette because I wanted to focus my shop on making fun gamer/nerd reference related merchandise. I'm not super happy with it, but I think it's good enough for now.

![Parsnip Designs Store Banner](/articles/parsnip-designs-logo.png "Parsnip Designs Store Banner")

I also made a store banner.

Behold! My Zazzle Store, [Parsnip Designs](https://www.zazzle.com/store/parsnipdesigns).

## I Made a Mug!

I randomly decided to go with making a mug design. The surface area is small, and the nature of the object makes it perfect for a short, whitty slogan and/or image.

### A Spider-man Eyes Mug

Originally, I wanted to make a close-up of Spider-man eyes on a mug.

![Close-up of Miles Morales in Spiderverse](/articles/miles-morales-spiderverse.jpg "Photo: Sony")

Something like the eyeholes on this mask on a mug I thought would look really cool. Unfortunately, in the process of mocking it up I found that it wasn't as cool as I thought it would be. Another thing to watch out for is that designs you make with the built-in product maker can't wrap all the way around the mug.

### I Could be GAMING Right Now

My second, less ambitious idea was to make a mug that says "I could be GAMING right now".

![Gamer mug](/articles/gamer-mug.png)

I feel like this is good for a moderate chuckle, but it doesn't have the "I have to buy it" factor. Also I recall not having enough graphical design skill to make this text as fancy as it could have been.

![Gamer mug variant](/articles/gamer-mug2.png "I also made a second variant that I didn't use")

Seeing the Zazzle tool superimpose the image on a mug was pretty cool.

![Gamer mug product preview](/articles/i-could-be-gaming-mug.png)

I finally hit submit and then sat back and waited for the moolah to roll in. But...

![Mug Store Page With Analytics](/articles/zazzle-mug-store.png "Wow... a whole 14 views...")

Nothing happened.

### Why Is The Mug Fifteen Dollars?!

You might be wondering why the mug is so expensive. Or at least yelling at your computer screen about how I made the price too high! Using the platform leaves me no choice but to be complicit in creating overpriced merch.

![Zazzle Royalties Breakdown](/articles/zazzle-mug-royalties.png "Royalty you will make: $1.24 -- Price for product: $15.45 (!!)")

As you can see in the royalty breakdown, I'm making slightly more than a dollar per mug! (Or I would be, if I was able to sell one) Going any cheaper would mean I'd not make anything from selling mugs. If I try to change the royalty to something like 12-15%, the price jumps up to $20! That means whatever I design has to be unbelievabily desirable for someone to buy it at this price...

Man, they weren't exaggerating when they said that the e-commerce platforms took a big chunk out of each transaction. I've heard people complaining that Etsy takes up to 35% of profits, but I can't really figure out how 35% fits in anywhere??? From what I'm seeing, they're taking waaaay more than 35%...

## Advertising your Online Store

Ok, so I have an online store and a published product. Now what do I do? It's time to spread the word around and get some traffic, I think?

This is the part where I ran into a wall. I don't really have any other sources of guidance other than Google searches. And what I found from searching "how to increase traffic to your store" was to advertise it on your social media accounts, to friends, facebook, twitter, your blog, etc. This advice didn't work for me. I don't have a social media following, nor do I have many real life acquaintences that would be interested in mid-tier geek paraphernalia. I suppose I could buy facebook advertisements and stuff, but I'm hesitant to drop some real money on this unless I have a few really strong products around first. I mean, I can't say that I'd buy my own mug.

And this is the unfortunate part, because advertising and driving traffic is probably the most important part of this whole ordeal. You can't get sales if no one sees the store, after all.

## Why I Stopped (For Now)

At this point, I realized I didn't have any other ideas I could realistically try. Either I wanted to do something beyond my abilities, or a witty idea that was half-baked and not funny. Like, for example I would think about making a cool T-shirt with chainsaws and explosions on it, but I cannot draw those things in a way that people would pay money for.

Looking back to the Work Diet, I had to take a step back and think if I should concentrate on refining my product ideas or do something else from the list that seemed closer to my grasp. I decided to switch to web development, since I've been doing that since high school and was doing that professionally until last year. I have some experience in web development already, so maybe pushing out a few website ideas would be faster than beginning a new journey as a graphic designer.

So that's why my arts and crafts store is on pause. On the bright side, I don't have to stop forever. I can work on other things and if I stumble into having a product I'm proud of, I can pick up where I left off.

### Lessons Learned

1. You don't have to be a godly artist to make good products, but you do need to be creative to find clever and doable ideas. Take a look at existing shops and see if you can take a clever idea and put a small twist on it.

1. Advertising, advertising, advertising. I'm not much of a self-promoter, and I'm only realizing how much repetition and constant chipping away it takes to get traffic coming to a new website.

1. As a corollary to the previous -- I don't know the first thing about marketing. That is a weakness I would need to make up for, probably by outsourcing.

1. Decide if you want to outsource graphic design, marketing, or other skills to people who can do it better/faster. You can trade money for skills, but you need to determine if you can afford it.

1. You will make almost nothing from each product sale *AND* the product will still be overpriced. That's the nature of using a 3rd-party service instead of running your own business from scratch. This is important to know for aspiring entrepreneurs who are trying to pick *any* kind of platform.

1. I was in a creative slump for quite some time. It's kind of a recurring pattern in my life where I feel like I have to choose between tech and art, and usually art loses. I had a chance to exercise some artistic skills here and made a logo and a mug design. I kind of want to practice some more and get better!

## Current Status

No change! Gotta pick myself up, brush off the dirt, and try again.

<PieChart title="Income Breakdown" legend="Per Month" amount_format={"${amount} ({percent}%)"} data={[{ name: "Stocks", amount: 200 }]} />

<StackedBarChart title={"Monthly Total"} legend={''} data={[{ month: 'April', stocks: 200}]} />

I learned some interesting lessons here that I hope I can apply to future endeavors. I'm expecting to fail a lot in the beginning. I just hope that I have the strength to push through until I get some traction on *something*.
