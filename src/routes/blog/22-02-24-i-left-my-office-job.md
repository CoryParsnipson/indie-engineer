summary: This is my first post on Indie Engineer! Thanks for reading. In this post, I talk about my motivations in starting this blog. I also give a bit of my background. I'm trying to set up a work routine for myself that does not rely on being part of a company. This may mean being a freelancer, or independent maker, or a whole bunch of things at the same time. To solve this issue, I've come up with something called a 'Work Diet'. This is a tool for helping myself stay organized. I talk in detail about what it is and how it works.

It's no secret that working a corporate job really sucks sometimes. Maybe you've heard someone complain about unnecessary meetings, cancelled projects, lay-offs, tedious small talk, or navigating office politics. There's a lot of downsides to well-paying stability, and if you feel like the cons outweight the pros, the good news is that you're not alone. I feel this way too. :) But what can we do about it?

The success stories are abundant--people make millions writing apps. Others hit it big doing YouTube or streaming. Many more tell stories about having a flash of inspiration and growing it into a thriving business. And then there's me.

## Is it Possible to be an Independent Engineer?

How do you go from square one to front page success story? Is it possible to do this without winning the lottery? How about without leaning on someone or something else for support in the meantime? This happens to be the situation I find myself in, and I intend to get to the bottom of this mystery. I set up this blog to document my experiences doing that.

## A Little Bit About Me

Hi, I'm Cory Parsnipson. I spent almost a decade between a handful of tech jobs in a couple industries, including cloud infrastructure and computer chip design. Some of these jobs were extremely laid back and others were chaotic and subject to tight deadlines. No matter where I went, the work didn't feel meaningful. Whether or not I was bored out of my mind or having a 24/7 stress-induced stomach-ache, something was missing. I always felt like I should be doing something else instead of being distracted by the work in front of me. 

![Burnt out office worker](/burnout.png "That feeling when...")

I quit my last job at the end of 2020 with no plan. I was burnt out from office work and web development. True story--it was literally 9 months before I could open an IDE without feeling nauseous. Repeatedly cancelled projects led to months or years of work just vanishing in a poof of smoke. I watched myself miss out on many opportunites, while getting below market-rate pay most of the time. I realized that programming, web development, and computer hardware design was fun, but the PR footwork of selling my accomplishments to the manager who needs to hear it was not. I simply wasn't cutting it in the corporate world.

## Fixing my Work Diet

![Vegetables with the words 'Eat Healthy' between them. 'Eat' is crossed out in red and replaced with 'Work'](/work-healthy.png)

I'm going to try something different so, for now, getting a salaried office job is a last resort. But getting started is proving to be a daunting task. Finding a tech job replacement that has none of the drawbacks is a tall order. Fortunately, I realized that I don't have to come up with a full-blown replacement in one giant leap--I can find a bunch of part-time side hustles to do this instead. This is something I've been thinking about a lot lately, and I've recently decided to call it a "Work Diet". Take a look at this chart I made:

<WorkDiet data=
  {[
    [
      { item: "Uber driving", hours: 14, status: "active" },
      { item: "freelancing", hours: 6, status: "active" },
      { item: "tutoring", hours: 0, status: "paused" },
      { item: "stocks", hours: 0, status: "active" },
    ],
    [
      { item: "blogging", hours: 12, status: "active" },
      { item: "Etsy / Redbubble / Zazzle", hours: 5, status: "paused" },
      { item: "real estate investing", hours: 3, status: "active" },
      { item: "streaming", hours: 0, status: "inactive"},
    ],
    [
      { item: "websites", hours: 5, status: "paused" },
      { item: "apps", hours: 5, status: "paused" },
      { item: "APIs", hours: 5, status: "paused" },
    ],
    [
      { item: "art", hours: 0, status: "inactive" },
      { item: "making videogames", hours: 0, status: "inactive"},
      { item: "3D modeling", hours: 0, status: "inactive" },
    ],
    [
      {item: "RPi game console", hours: 0, status: "paused"},
    ]
  ]} />

The idea is to try out these items one by one, starting from the bottom. I maintain the ones I like and discard the rest. Eventually I should end up juggling a small handful of things that will hopefully provide enough income to cover my living expenses. There's some jobs, such as "stocks", that require very little active work and having many of those types of things will let me juggle more things without overwhelming myself with work.

I took my skills and background into consideration when picking things that sound fun and wrote them down into this list. Since I have experience in web development, making websites and apps or webservices (a.k.a. APIs) is definitely going on there. I've done Uber driving in the past so I know what that's going to be like. I am also open to being a freelance software developer. Tutoring might be an opportunity for new experiences and streaming looks fun, so those go on the list too. The best type of jobs are ones that are flexible. That is, you set your own hours and can do them anywhere.

On the right side of the chart is a list of approximate hours worked per week for each level. This is an informal tracker of how much time I'm spending on each level. The goal is to eventually spend most of my hours on the top level stuff and none of it on the bottom. More on this below.

At the very top is something called "RPi game console", which might need some explanation. I spent most of last year trying to make a portable "Nintendo Switch" knock-off using a Raspberry Pi portable computer. I'm documenting the process in an [internet forum thread](https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3947328).

![Raspberry Pi Game Console Prototype](/rpi-prototype.jpg "Here's a picture of the working prototype I made")

Digging into circuit designs, working with sensors, and learning how to use a 3D printer was new and exciting to me. The prototype eventually came together, but I realized at the end of the year that there's still so much more work to do and not a sliver of a guarantee that I can support myself with it. As a career goal, this is a totally valid pursuit, but I need something to support myself in the meantime. That's what the rest of this chart is for.

### Filling out a Work Diet (How to Pick Jobs)

The best advice I've heard so far about going it alone comes from this random YouTube video I saw by someone named "struthless": [Before you "quit your job and follow your passion" watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz1kVa8brLg&t=610s) In a nutshell, what he says is:

1. Make sure you are unburdened--i.e. not in debt, injured, or overly-encumbered providing for family
1. Branch out and explore in many directions
1. Focus on the most exciting things you tried; ideally they are high risk, high reward items.
1. Work in the direction of creating a life where you have the option of saying "no" to things that drain you of energy.

This has a lot of overlap with what I'm trying to do. High risk, high reward jobs are at the top. There's no guaranteed payoff from doing these things. Low risk, instant gratification jobs are at the bottom. These jobs are for short term support. And then in the middle are jobs that can provide income without having to actively work on it.

Picking safe jobs is trickier than it looks. *"I could be a streamer! Or maybe I could be a skydiving instructor! Or..."* I had to resist my impulse to just spit-ball ideas and take genuine, blunt assessment of my marketable skills. Everything is harder and takes longer than you'd think. Only jobs where you can confidently say that you'd be making money within weeks are allowed in this level. The answers here will be surprising.

![Streaming desk setup](/streamer.png)

Do I know I can make money streaming? I have no idea which means the answer is probably no. At this point, it's a hobby. Does skydiving instructor fit? Nope. Unless I was already one, it would take time to learn how and get certified before I could make money. And that's time and energy I could be spending on top level items. I had to greatly lower my expectations when picking at this level.

I was able to find one or two applicable jobs when I dug deep and I think most people could do the same after enough thinking. I briefly did a stint driving for Uber in 2014 out of curiosity. This falls into safe job category pretty perfectly because I know exactly what to expect and I also know that it takes about a week to do the car inspection and get documentation in order. Once those things are all set I can walk out the door and start making money. I also feel obligated to say that driving for Uber is a pretty crappy job, and that this is a temporary thing for me. I'm hoping to discover more safe jobs after a bit of exploring and that will give me options in case I find Uber driving to be unsustainable.

The good news is that for a lot of people, their current job could fit into the bottom. The initial cost has already been paid. The catch is that if the job leaves no free time or leftover energy outside of it, then the job is essentially useless for this purpose.

### Goals and Benefits of doing a Work Diet

#### The Work Diet Points you to "Follow your Passion"

![A crossroads](/crossroads.png)

The original idea was to organize ideas in order of *time until income is achieved*. I needed money quickly to slow my dwindling savings but I also wanted to chase something cool. As a side effect of arranging everything like this, the chart above ends up being organized similarly to [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html). This is no coincidence. The jobs at the bottom meet some immediate needs and the jobs at the top are intellectually rewarding ventures. Like Maslow's hierarchy, I can move to concentrate on upper levels once the lower level things are stabilized. Sometimes setbacks occur and things on the lower levels need to be taken care of. Moving up and down the hierarchy is normal and that's what I expect I'll have to do too.

#### Diversification Provides Better Protection Against Surprises

Having several source of income can mitigate against misfortunes such as a layoff or industry-wide recession. I think there may be mental benefits too. Certain things are less stressful because I can switch focus to different items when I'm feeling stuck or bored.

#### A Work Diet Encourages Flexibility and Exploration

This could be a once-in-a-lifetime chance to explore new things. The Work Diet lets me do this because I can add different things and try them out one by one. I'm free to add/change/remove them as necessary without having to improvise outside the framework. There's also less monotony, which was a problem for me in a cubicle job.

#### Everything Doubles as a Self-Support Toolbox

![A red toolbox with tools in it](/toolbox.png)

This becomes a (employment) survival toolbox. Jobs that I stop doing in favor of better ones can always be revisited as needed. For instance, once I stop driving for Uber, I can always pick it up every once in a while if I'm going on a long trip and need a few bucks to pay for gas. Perhaps I will gather many tips and tricks for landing on my feet in a wide range of situations?

### Work Diet in the Long Term

The Work Diet chart also takes inspiration from the [food pyramid](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-pyramid/). Like a food pyramid, the chart is triangular in shape, with the relative area of each tier indicative of roughly how much time I should spend on it. In the beginning, the items at the bottom are expected to make up the bulk of my monthly income. I need to cover about $2.3k of monthly living expenses. Any working time I have left over can be distributed across items in the upper levels.

<WorkDiet show_layer_names={true} show_hours={false} data=
  {[
    [
      { item: "Uber driving", hours: 14, status: "active" },
      { item: "freelancing", hours: 6, status: "active" },
      { item: "tutoring", hours: 0, status: "paused" },
      { item: "stocks", hours: 0, status: "active" },
    ],
    [
      { item: "blogging", hours: 12, status: "active" },
      { item: "Etsy / Redbubble / Zazzle", hours: 5, status: "paused" },
      { item: "real estate investing", hours: 3, status: "active" },
      { item: "streaming", hours: 0, status: "inactive"},
    ],
    [
      { item: "websites", hours: 5, status: "paused" },
      { item: "apps", hours: 5, status: "paused" },
      { item: "APIs", hours: 5, status: "paused" },
    ],
    [
      { item: "art", hours: 0, status: "inactive" },
      { item: "making videogames", hours: 0, status: "inactive"},
      { item: "3D modeling", hours: 0, status: "inactive" },
    ],
    [
      {item: "RPi game console", hours: 0, status: "paused"},
    ]
  ]} />

I've annotated the Work Diet chart above to illustrate what categories of jobs go into each level and what I'm expecting in terms of "royalties" from each level. While most of what I'm saying is flexible and allows one to mix and match, the taxonomy here is quite important. I'm counting on passive income from the middle jobs to cover most of my living expenses. And yes, that is a *huge* assumption I'm making here. I hope to test this hypothesis out on the blog. If I can do this, it should free up my time to work on the top level items. More importantly, this should give me some cushion and breathing room to just relax and enjoy life.
