title: "Tips to Get Started Freelancing Online and 4 Kinds of Clients You'll Meet"
author: Cory Parsnipson
summary: Are online gig marketplaces a good place to get started freelancing? I give it a try and signed up for accounts on Freelancer.com and Thumbtack. I put together a list of tips for people new to Freelancer and a list of 4 different types of clients you may come across. Freelancing is a tough business.

Every *"how I made $[x] per month with [y] passive income streams"* list ever made has "freelancing" listed near the top. I took this at face value. I would read this and think, "Of course--you quit your job and become a freelancer. That's how it goes!" I went into this with the naivete of a Disney character, as if one could just decide to freelance and then live happily ever after.

Those same articles tell you that online gig marketplaces like [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com) are a great place to get started quick. Are the stories true? Well, I gave it a try and, man, it was completely different from what I thought it was going to be like.

## Freelancer.com

I went with [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com) over Upwork. I don't remember why, I just picked one. I think Upwork has a much better reputation but I don't think the experience will be much different.

Freelancer is different from most of the other marketplace websites, like Upwork. In those sites, you sign up for an account, set up your profile, and then create a page that describes what kind of work you offer and advertise to clients to buy your service.

Freelancer inverts this by having people who need work post details about their job and then have the freelancers bid on jobs with brief pitches and work samples (if applicable). I think this presents several issues for the casual freelancer.

##### Landing the First Gig is the Hardest Part

If you have a new profile with no ratings, it will be very hard getting prospective clients. Getting the first job is the hardest part. I've seen articles recommending everything from working for very low rates, or free, to grey area type stuff like asking some friends to buy your service and leave a couple starter ratings. It is hardest in the beginning and you'll need to hustle extra hard to land that first job.

##### It's a Race to the Bottom

The rates on Freelancer are extremely low. Lower than I'd even would have guessed. I did not see any other freelancers based in the US. I might be locked out of this whole scene because I'm unable to compete on hourly rate.

##### Lower Barrier to Entry Means Lower Quality Work

Similar to the last point, Freelancer makes it easy to sign up and start bidding for work. You don't even have to prepare a description or samples for work you do, like you would on other platforms. Everything is pretty sketchy looking. There's nothing stopping people from putting down insanely low numbers or unteniable promises to get the winning bid.

##### Don't Listen to Anyone Who Asks for Your WhatsApp

Don't humor people who ask for your Whatsapp to continue the conversation there. They are trying to get you to deliver work and then skip out on paying you. Keep all conversations and file uploads on the official website. This is the most basic scam on the site.

##### Freelancer is Full of Bots and Scammers

That sort of leads into this next point--most of my initial engagement with people on the site were mostly scammers. Most people I talked to wanted to use WhatsApp and even the ones who didn't were pretty shady. This is pretty common for marketplace and dating apps.

## My Experiences with Clients

The people of freelancer work tirelessly everyday to see that customers' jobs get done. These are their stories. Donk donk.

### 1. Guy who wanted some faces to be photoshopped

The first thing I did was search for small photo editing jobs. It sounded like a fun way to ease myself into the groove. I found a guy who wanted some faces to be photoshopped onto a picture as a prank. I wrote a bid saying that I had experience editing photos and provided a couple examples and that I'd do it for $10.

![Face Manipulation Demo](/articles/face-edit.jpg "I replaced the faces and color-matched in this photo.")

No response. I thought I smashed it out of the park with my bid. Sad!

Most of my bids were unanswered. This is probably what'll happen most of the time. Getting jobs is a crap-shoot.

### 2. Guy who wanted me to make a wordpress website for $30

I was drawn to this job offer because it was short and to the point and very specific. He wanted a wordpress website for 3 reasons: to advertise his book, to let him write blog entries every so often, and to add a contact form for people to mail him. And he claimed to pay $30 for this to be done.

This seemed like the perfect first job. I haven't used wordpress since high-school, but I'm sure I could figure it out in a couple hours.

He actually got back to me this time, but sounded completely different in the chat messages.

![Chat Log with Wordpress Guy](/articles/freelancer-wordpress-guy.png "Three question marks made him sound like a crazy old person")

Unfortunately, this guy wanted to exchange WhatsApp information, so I requested to stay on the site. Then I never heard back from him. *Drat!*

### 3. Business who Wanted Text Transcription from Images

Freelancer's own policy says not to deal with anyone who wants to go to WhatsApp and, in fact, they'll ban anyone who is soliciting for that. But this was so common that everyone who responded to me wanted a WhatsApp. I couldn't help but wonder if it was really true that only scammers used it?

This time I actually connected with the potential client over WhatsApp. The job was to do text entry transcribing words in scanned images. Man this was a doozy. He sent me a PDF that explained how everything worked. I needed to make an *$80 deposit* (!!) before I did anything to "make sure the bank information is correct". Sheesh.

I blocked him and reported him to the admins. I really hope he can't find me from my WhatsApp profile details...

### 4. The Last Straw

I found a gig from a guy named "Marcelo" that needed unit testing for a CMS. The prompt had a very simple coding question of iterating over a list in python. I send in a bid that had two answers, one simple, and another using pythonic list comprehension.

I think the coding sample helped him get back to me. This guy seemed legit, which was pretty refreshing, but his budget was non-existent.

![Chat Log with Marcelo](/articles/freelancer-marcelo.png)

I messed up. I shouldn't have said "I have beginner level experience" even though I've only used Selenium once before, for a total of half an hour. He said my bid was too high for a beginner. My bid?

It was *$8 an hour*.

I ended up rage-quitting at this point thinking that $8 an hour was less than I could make doing other things, like driving for Uber. Advice articles for this stuff say you may have to work for free in the beginning, but I was highly dubious that I'd be able to parley this experience into more and higher pay gigs.

## Thumbtack

The next day I gave it some thought and signed up for [Thumbtack](https://www.thumbtack.com), a similar online freelancing marketplace. Thumbtack, being based in San Francisco, seemed to be aiming for higher quality freelancers and clients. The way they did this was to filter out people by requiring higher up-front fees.

![Thumbtack Results for Web Developers](/articles/thumbtack.png "Everything seems less shady")

Thumbtack requires you to pay to get your name in front of "leads", their name for clients who will see your job postings. There is no guarantee that they will hire you and you have to pay this price regardless of outcome. I think the price is different for everyone, but for me it cost $200 a week to do this.

This, sadly, gave me pause. I can't really afford paying this much money and, being a complete beginner, I was not confident that I could build a pipeline before I ran out of money.

## Lessons Learned

Ok I'm sensing a pattern here. I'm floundering pretty hard when it comes to setting up a business. Learning from both my experiences with the online store and now this, I seem to be missing quite a large skillset for negotiation and self-promotion. It's quite daunting, actually.

In retrospect, I may be giving up a little too early. I wonder if a little tenacity and some faith is just what I need to get me over the initial hump of finding that first client.

## Current Status

The freelancing category is greyed out because I decided this was a dead-end. I might be better served spending energy on something else. Also I don't think this belongs on the lowest layer, given my recent experiences.

  ]} />

So far I've tried 3 things and they haven't really worked out. A bit demotivating, but this is to be expected. I gotta push through if I want to succeed.
