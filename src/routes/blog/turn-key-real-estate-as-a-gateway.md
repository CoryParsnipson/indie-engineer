Real estate has been described as the quickest way to build wealth. If you're anything like me, you probably think that getting into real estate would take millions in cold, hard cash. I am intrigued to find out that it's not the case.

A few minutes flipping through Forbes real estate articles opened my eyes. I read a few stories about how a broke college student put together $60,000 for a down payment on a house and then got their start by flipping it and putting the profits into bigger and bigger houses. That's the price of a nice car, isn't it? Maybe I could take a huge chunk of my savings from work and put it into real estate for some nice passive income.

## What if you Live in an Expensive Housing Market?

I live in the Bay Area, one of the most expensive housing markets in the country. Houses here average between 1 and 2 million dollars and everything has basically tripled in value due to unchecked inflation. If you don't have millions of dollars in cash or credit then you *are* locked out of the housing market here.

One of the ways you can still get into the real estate business is to go long distance. I came across something called *turn-key real estate*, where you pay a premium to have properties managed for you by a team of people.

I found a particularly informative article titled, ["Are Turnkey Rental Properties Worth It?"](https://www.rentalincomeadvisors.com/blog/are-turnkey-rentals-worth-it#:~:text=The%20primary%20benefits%20of%20buying,so%20you%20can%20cash%20flow) from a blog called [Rental Income Advisors](https://www.rentalincomeadvisors.com/). The author was comparing cash flow from traditionally managed properties versus Turnkey properties.

![Expenses and cashflow of turnkey numbers](/articles/turnkey-numbers.png "Screenshot of his data. Seriously, read that article.")

What I liked about the article was that he backed up his findings with detailed data and he explained terms and metrics to make his article accessible to outsiders like me.

It was around this time that I was wondering what I should do next. Jumping in headfirst was pretty daunting, especially because there was such a big upfront cost. I was scared of getting stuck with a house thousands of miles away and not being able to get rid of it without losing a lot of money.

This would be a great time to go find a mentor. Coincidentally, Rental Income Advisors has a bold button that says "Free Consultation" right at the top of the page.

[I signed the hell up](https://www.rentalincomeadvisors.com/contact). One week later, I was on a zoom call with Eric himself and I had half an hour to ask him all the questions I had about my anxieties of jumping into real estate.

The resulting "interview" was quite valuable to me, and I think it is worth reproducing here.

## Consultation with Eric Hughes (Rental Income Advisors)

Eric Hughes is the owner of turn key real estate advising blog Rental Income Advisors.

### Q: What is the coaching program?

The coaching program leads people to buy their first 4-5 houses and become familiar enough to manage/grow their own portfolio. There’s a mix of 1-on-1 sessions for asking questions, reviewing administrative tasks, and then contacting companies and researching properties.

Clients should have 100K+ of liquid assets ready before beginning. It is recommended to start with 5 properties to reduce short term volatility in your portfolio. *[At the time of the interview (February 2022), 100k was expected to pay for 4 houses.]* 

### Q: What is the fee structure of your coaching services?

Rental Income Advisors charges twice the monthly rent of the property paid one time when the property is closed. This is per property, so a total of approximately $10k.

### Q: Is there an expected range of income to investment I can expect?

Ratio of income to investment is a measure of “cash per door” (e.g. $200 per house per month). [Eric] prefers thinking about things in terms of % yield, known as “cash on cash yield” in real estate circles. This gives you information about how much income you are getting per amount invested.

For example, if you buy a mortgage for a house in Memphis with a down payment of ~25k, and the income after expenses is $250 per month, then your cash on cash is ((12 \* 250) / 25000 \* 100 = 12%). For a market like Memphis, you can expect about 10% yield in general, though the volatility will make this a very approximate estimate.

### Q: What would be considered a small, medium, and large size portfolio?

A small portfolio would be less than or equal to 5 houses (“doors”), a mid size is 15-20 doors, and a large is 20+. Large portfolios aren't very common.

### Q: I'm intimidated by the initial cash investment. What kinds of things can someone do to mitigate risk?

It’s not that bad. In some place like Memphis, you’re not going to be putting more than 30k into a house and that’s already a lot of money.

### Q: What are some good resources for beginners?

There’s 3 main things:

1. Read the [Rental Income Advisors blog](https://www.rentalincomeadvisors.com/) (Eric’s blog). Contains a lot of articles geared towards newbies and doesn’t assume known information. Check out articles about cash on cash yield, getting approved for mortgages, etc.

1. Brandon Turner ([BiggerPockets](https://www.biggerpockets.com)) has a good book for beginners:
[How to Invest in Real Estate: The Ultimate Beginner's Guide to Getting Started](https://www.amazon.com/How-Invest-Real-Estate-Beginners-ebook/dp/B07HY1LRCS). These might also be interesting: [The Book on Investing In Real Estate with No (and Low) Money Down](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B9YDN3D) and [The Book on Rental Property Investing: How to Create Wealth with Intelligent Buy and Hold Real Estate Investing](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Rental-Property-Investing-Passive-ebook/dp/B018UTI2DO)

1. The [“Afford anything” podcast by Paula Pant](https://affordanything.com/podcast/). This isn’t strictly about real estate but it’s got a lot of applicable and useful mindset/ideas.

### Q: What do I need to be someone who is ready for your coaching program?

The important part is the liquid assets. Get to 100k+ and then we can begin coaching, that’s the main part. [I suspect realistic total expenses will be around 150k-160k to account for turnkey premium, accounting enough money for buying 5 houses, and coaching fees].

Another thing to worry about is getting approved for mortgages. That’s a big thing. You really need to be able to show the bank your W2 monthly income statements to get approval. It’s very hard to get approved without a steady W2 job.

## Following Up

Okay, so clearly, I need to do some more research. Eric emphasized that the book from Brandon Turner would be a great start. I bought a copy to read while Uber driving.

Also, I need to go to the bank and see what they say about getting a mortgage approved. I'm not expecting it to go well...

## Current Status

I'm going to reluctantly mark this as "blocked" for the time being, as current market conditions are making it difficult for me to continue with this.

My timing on this is extremely bad. I wish I had this idea before I quit my day job. Getting the funds to go through with this will be difficult without a mortgage.

Current events are making it harder to do specifically what I'm trying to do--invest in real estate. The US treasury has raised rates faster than they've ever done in the past 40 years with the express purpose of making it harder for people to spend money on credit. That's essentially what curbing inflation means.

Not only that, but higher interest rates means higher mortgage payments, and ultimately lower monthly cash flow. This makes it harder to find houses with attractive monthly cash flow.

The stock market is depressed because of the interest rates too. A large portion of my savings are gone, so liquidating my stock right now would be a very bad idea.

<PieChart title="Income Breakdown" legend="Per Month" amount_format={"${amount} ({percent}%)"} data={[{ name: "Stocks", amount: 200 }, { name: "Uber", amount: 2400 }]} />

<StackedBarChart title={"Monthly Total"} legend={''} data={[{ month: 'June', stocks: 200, uber: 2400}]} />

This is turning out to be both easier and harder than I expected. I'm kind of bummed that owning real estate is still beyond my reach. All I can do now is educate myself and be patient.
