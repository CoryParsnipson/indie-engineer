I started trading stocks shortly after I started my first job. I went into it with almost no prior experience. When I thought of it, I imagined guys in suits screaming at each other on the trading room floor. It sounded like a fun gambling hobby.

Luckily I cut that out pretty soon because it was a dumb way to trade stocks and I learned about the difference between *speculating* (gambling, basically) and *investing*. Speculation refers to the act of buying something with the hopes that you will be able to sell it for more money in the near future. Investing refers to acquiring assets that will steadily increase in value and remain valuable forever. The line between the two is blurry, but typically they are easy to distinguish from each other.

## Speculation vs. Investing

Wild speculation is what most people think of when they hear "stock market" and gives stocks a bad name. Investing, however, is something I truly think is a responsibility of anyone who is well enough to have a savings account. I consider it an important life skill, like being able to use a computer or cook a simple meal. Because of the unfortunate realities of our modern economy, I think that investing in stocks is a necessity for someone who is looking to retire at some point.

### Do This, If Nothing Else

It may sound daunting at first, but honestly, it's so simple I can sum it up in a couple of sentences:

> Set aside an emergency fund and keep your checking account topped up with enough money to comfortably pay your monthly expenses. Open a [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/home) account, and dump the rest of your money into it. Buy a handful of broad market index funds, like [VOO](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/voo) and then just leave it there until you retire.

Seriously, it's that easy. And not only that, but *this is close to the best anyone can do*. Can you imagine any other thing where achieving near peak performance is so simple?? If this is too good to be true, allow me the rest of this post to explain.

And if it sounds boring, good! It should be. Put the money away and forget about it for 40 years. Stocks don't have to be gambling.

## Going from a Gamble to a Calculated Risk

If you're afraid that you'll lose money by putting your savings into the stock market, just know that there are ways to greatly reduce your risk. There's no need to gamble on the unpredictable-ness and volatility of a single stock when you can buy an ETF or mutual fund that tracks the whole market.

### Here's why Buying the Market is Different from Buying any other Stock (and the Only Stock you Need)

The market as a whole is more stable than any of its individual constituents. We have hundreds of years of economic data and the long term trend shows us that stocks reliable increase in price between 5 - 10% every year. The only exceptions are during recessions and if you're saving for retirement, your timeline is long enough to ignore them. That's what your steady job and emergency fund are for. And remember this--the market has surged back stronger than ever after every single recession. Every single one.

If you buy the market as a whole, then you won't lose (but you won't win big either). The interesting thing is that almost nobody can do better than the market anyway. The professionals on Wall Street can practice their stock picking mumbo jumbo, but sustaining higher returns than average for a long period of time is very, very rare. So going into a broad ETF is the easy and safe choice, AND it's nearly the optimal choice and best ROI for the individual investor.

### Why you Shouldn't Keep your Savings in Cash

This 5 - 10% appreciation number is important specifically because there's a thing called *inflation*. Each year the dollar gets less valuable as the price of goods and the amount of cash in circulation increase. Inflation will erode your savings like a sand-castle on the beach at high tide. Typically, inflation is at 3% a year, effectively meaning that cash is 3% less valuable each year. The appreciation on stock assets helps people combat the effects of inflation because stocks increase to offset that and then some. And if you're having money sit in a savings account for years, why not put it to work for absolutely no effort?

![Sandcastle on the beach in front of boats](/articles/rising-tides.png "Something, something rising tides...")

Recent world events have transpired to give us inflation that is at an unprecedented high (around 8% in 2022). This is bad news for everyone. But even in this worse case scenario, having your savings in stock is much, much better than leaving it in cash, isn't it? That's what the government is doing. It's also what the most rich and powerful people are doing too. There is a vested interest in sustaining the economy, so when you buy into stocks, you are getting into the same boat as all these people working hard to make sure the economy doesn't collapse. Rise with the tide instead of being washed away by it.

## Yield is Everything

When I spent a year unemployed, I spent about $30k that year on living expenses and rent. I didn't have much fun either because even though I had a bunch of free time I was worried about my future and about spending too much money. At the end of it, I was left with nothing and when I went back to work I was broke and I had to start saving again from square one. It was like I lost *two* years of my life...

Sometime after I went back to work, I learned about stocks and how to build a portfolio and how to open a 401k. I saved another $30k and found out how far money can be stretched. If you have the opportunity to invest, doing so will increase your quality of life with very little downside.

### How Much Money is Enough?

Finally, after you've set up a portfolio, how do you know when to stop? It is interesting that there is a very specific answer to this question. That goal is save about $2 million in your portfolio by the time you retire. This is the amount as of the time of this writing, but the exact number changes over time because of increased cost of living.

This number isn't random. If you withdraw 4% or less of your retirement money every year, you should be able to cover the money you spend with the interest that comes out of your portfolio. This is called the [4 Percent Rule](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/beyond-4-rule-how-much-can-you-spend-retirement) and it's a good starting point for managing retirement spending. Essentially, this means that your retirement will not be on a time limit. However, interest has a really low yield and that's why it takes such a big number for you to live off only the interest.

Indeed, it's a looooot of money, so that is why people are advised to save early and consistently. And that's also why compound interest is so important, because it exponentially reduces the amount of money and time it takes to get to the goal.

## Further Reading

Sometimes when you start learning something, there will be this one book, a *master-text*, that will comprehensively inform readers of the occupational landscape and clearly explain all fundamental bulding blocks. Fortunately for us, the finance world has [The Four Pillars of Investing](https://www.amazon.com/Four-Pillars-Investing-Building-Portfolio-ebook/dp/B0041842TW) by William Bernstein. *(Disclaimer: this is not an affiliate link)*

Everything in this blog post and all the facts and numbers I quoted come directly from this book. If you want to learn more of anything I talked about here, I highly recommend reading it!
